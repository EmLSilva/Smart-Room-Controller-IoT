# CATS LOVE DOGS HATE TOY [link to project: (https://www.hackster.io/emily-silva/cats-love-dogs-hate-toy-69719b)]
In a household of gnarled dog toys, this is a cat toy designed to keep away dogs and allow cats to enjoy a toy entirely of their own.
## About
Cats Love Dogs Hate Toy is about creating a new 'Mouse' cat toy that can be enjoyed solely by the cats - and not the dogs, who love to chew new cat toys!

Using an ultrasonic sensor, dog movement is detected within close range of the 'Mouse' cat-only toy. When movement is detected, "BAD DOG" mode is set! The toy issues a high-pitched buzzer, red LED mouse eyes light up, a red Hue light turns on, and a Wemo-activated fan is set off. "BAD DOG" displays on the OLED screen located at the 'Mouse' tail. When movement is no longer within close range, "GOOD DOG" mode is resetâ€”all alarms turn off, the Hue light turns blue, and the OLED screen displays "GOOD DOG".

Part two of this project will define dog movement from any other movement through a dog tag sensor. For part one, the 'Mouse' is equipped with an override button to delay the "BAD DOG" alarm and allow cat-only enjoyment of the 'Mouse'. When the furry and catnip-covered override button is pawed, "CATS RULE" displays on the OLED screen and the alarms disarm for 10 seconds (or longer if the cat's interest in the 'Mouse' continues).
